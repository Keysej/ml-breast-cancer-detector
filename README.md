ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project applies a logistic regression model to predict whether breast tumors are malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The model is implemented in Python using scikit-learn.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Algorithm: Logistic Regression  
- Dataset: `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`  
- Goal: Binary classification (Malignant = 0, Benign = 1)  
- Accuracy: ~93.86% on test data
